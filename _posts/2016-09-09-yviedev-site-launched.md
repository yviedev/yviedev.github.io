This is a true story of a lawyer turned web developer who documents her journey via a blog so that she doesn’t forget important things with so many “important” things to remember.

I came across <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this simple tutorial</a> on how I could create a personal webpage with my GitHub account and I thought it would be a good idea to try it out and build a personal website for myself since I am a web developer. It’s kind of neat to not have to rely on 3rd party applications like WordPress or Joomla (aka CRMs) when really want to learn how to do it yourself.

And so here here I am! But the actual story began years ago. By profession I am an attorney and I have been practicing for a little over seven years. I have worked in the legal industry for 10 years and I can say I am ready for a different type of challenge. I have always had an interest in technology and even took a few CS courses at Cornell in undergrad but I never made the jump into the deep end of the pool and stayed afloat. I don’t want to live my life without any regrets and I am grateful for everything I have learned thus far, but I am ready to start a new chapter of my life called Web Development.

I have enrolled in a coding bootcamp with a company called <a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/">Actualize</a> (which is a subsidiary of Anyone Can Learn to Code “ACLTC"). This program will run for about 4 months from mid-September 2016 until the end of January 2017. It will meet 5 times a week for 12 weeks and then after completing several group projects and one Capstone Project, I will have the opportunity to apprentice with a web agency owned by ACLTC called <a href="http://www.thedifferenceengine.io/">The Difference Engine</a> for up to 4 months. After this time period I will have enough knowledge and experience to start a new career as a web developer.

Of course, this is a very broad overview of how my life is going to play out over the next few months but this is precisely why I will be documenting my progress with this blog for my own personal and professional reflection and to provide an accounting/resource to other like-minded individuals who are interested in my journey or want to take a similar journey of their own.
