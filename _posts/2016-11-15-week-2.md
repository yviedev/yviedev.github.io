So far things are going pretty well even though bootcamp is quite time consuming. In the last week I have learned how to create and deploy a rails application. I want to get started with making applications and putting the best ones in my portfolio. I have been spending much time with CSS, especially [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) and after playing around with a few themes, I find it much easier to start from scratch or using a bare-bones theme to get the result I desire.

I have also learned about [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), [params](https://gorails.com/episodes/the-params-hash) and [ERB](http://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/). I have a few ideas for my capstone project and I can't wait to get started.

My goal for this weekend is to finish up a basic template for this website and to deploy at least 1 rails application.
