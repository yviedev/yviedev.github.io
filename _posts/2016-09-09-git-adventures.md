Last night, I worked on making a personal GitHub webpage after finding some general inspiration on <a href="http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/">Brian Douglas's blog</a>. Brian is basically a highly-motivated and almost self-taught web developer. He started off learning Ruby on Rails via a mentor with Bloc and was able to successfully transition from a career IT sales into a Jr. Developer position in about 5 months. I really appreciated his motivation and eagerness to try and learn. I found his blog so encouraging that I decided to try and build my own blog for free through my GitHub account.

 <strike>Last night when I got home around 10pm I got to work reading up on Jekyll and how to set things up. I am no stranger to HTML and so it did not take very long to figure things out and get some placeholder pages up. The one thing that I did struggle with was Git (insert long sigh here). Actually cloning and pushing repositories from GitHub is fairly basic but I was having some trouble with setting up a local repository with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) which is the editor that I use. The way I learned to to it was set up a new folder and corresponding files locally first, set up a local repository and then set a remote repository on GitHub and then connect to repository via terminal and then push. Needless to say I couldn't get things to work out well on the local end with VSCode and I ended up downloaded GitHub for Mac and connecting to Git that way.</strike> Hopefully with more practice things will get easier? Lol. Or not. If anyone has a fairly simple explanation of how to run through this process each time I need to set up a new local repository please let me know.

I have about a week left before I start my program with Actualize and so far I have completed: 
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">Codeacademy's Intro into JavaScript course</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/en/map#Basic JavaScript">freeCodeCamp's Intro into JavaScript course</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/en/map#HTML5 and CSS">freeCodeCamp's Intro into HTML5 and CSS course</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/en/map#Object Oriented and Functional Programming">freeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course</a></li>
</ol>

I would like to try and finish up an Intro Ruby course and do some additional Javascript challenges via codefights or something similar to <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer DeWalt's 180 Websites in 180 Days</a>. I like what Jen says about coding: JFDI...the compiler/interpreter doesn't care who you are. There will be mistakes along the way and I will look silly at times, BUT I will learn so much.

p.s. I need to learn how not to commit so often and/or how to amend or squash my commits.

p.p.s. I just learned that there is Markdown previewing in VSCode and so that should help with over-committing.

Update: What I was saying about the Git process wasn't entirely accurate but I will blog about it tomorrow.
