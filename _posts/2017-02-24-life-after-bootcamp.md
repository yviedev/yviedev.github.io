It's been awhile since I last blogged. Let's see, I have finished bootcamp and finished my Capstone project. I thought that bootcamp was a very rewarding experience. I was able to learn how to do something very technical in a very short period of time. Now I am volunteering to build a web application for an educational client via The Difference Engine. I am really excited about this project and I can't wait to share how it will turn out.

I am also taking some time just to relax and re-integrate back into normal life as well as catch up on some development reading so that I can stay sharp. Right now, I am reading a book by the founder of my bootcamp, Jay Wengrow, called "Common Sense Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms". Sounds like a fun Friday night, right?
