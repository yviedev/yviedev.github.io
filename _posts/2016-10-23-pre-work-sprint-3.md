In-person bootcamp is starting really soon. I am almost done with the last of my PreWork. I have a few more Ruby OOP and CSS exercises to complete. On Friday, I completed my Tic Tac Toe game. I am really pleased with myself. I played with my boyfriend and we kept tying. Finally, I just let him win so that he could see how the game_over method worked in all cases. Smh. I am still learning about OOP and when it is appropiate to create classes and modules. I've learned so much so far that programming occupies most of my thoughts most of the time. I have a short video of my Tic Tac Toe game below. Enjoy!
