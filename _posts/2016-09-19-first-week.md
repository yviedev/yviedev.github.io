I am feeling particularly confident today. I am also feeling kind of icky physically. It didn't help that it was raining today but it looks like the rain has lightened up. Yesterday, I started with Day #1 - Week 1 of 3 with the mandatory Pre-work that I have to complete in order to advance to the in-person bootcamp courses. At first glance there were 20-something videos and exercises to complete and I had a brief moment of panic but I have completed more than half already...hence the confident feeling. I understand that these lessons are super basic and that things will escalate rather quickly, but for now I am just enjoying the pace.

So far, I am enjoying learning Ruby. It is more intuitive than JavaScript in my opinion. It also helps immensely that I learned JavaScript first. Lol. If JavaScript is that mixed-messaged, flaky mutual friend that you have to learn how to tolerate, Ruby is her easy-going, friendly and bubbly cousin that you are happy to encounter. In any case, I am looking forward to continuing my training. :-)
