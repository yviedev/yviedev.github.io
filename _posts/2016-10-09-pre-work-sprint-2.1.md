I'm still trucking along. We are still in the "second week" even though it's week 3. Our cohort has been extended for 2 additional weeks to allow a few more students to join; so instead of 15 weeks, it will be 17 weeks and then we move on to the apprenticeship.

I finished all of week 2! ::fist pump:: We had some bonus exercises including beginning to write a program for the card game, <a href="https://github.com/yviedev/ACLTC/blob/master/war.rb" target="_blank">War</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)" target="_blank">(description)</a>. I understand the theory of what I have to write including arrays and hashes, but there are probably some other concepts that I am not fully aware of that would help immensely while writing.

There was also another bonus question to write a bubble sort algorithm in lieu of using the .sort method in Ruby as well as writing a program for the game <a href="https://github.com/yviedev/ACLTC/blob/master/connect_four.rb" target="_blank">Connect 4</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four" target="_blank">(description)</a>.

I was also introduced to Ruby GEM APIs, specifically, the <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/weather" target="_blank">Yahoo Weather API</a>. I was able to write a small program that runs in bash and will tell you the 7-day weather forecast when you enter a city and state.
