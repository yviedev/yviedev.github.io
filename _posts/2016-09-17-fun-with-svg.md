I spent the earlier part of the day learning about svgs and how to implement them onto my site. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVGs</a> are Scalable Vector Graphics. They are mostly different from regular images in that you can increase the size (pixel) of the image and it will not distort. You can also have <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/styling-and-animating-svgs-with-css/">plenty of fun with svgs and CSS</a>. I was able to find some free svgs and get the icons I wanted. I also added a hover style to my svgs so they would turn from purple to red. There are many more things I could do but now I am going to take a lunch break and then look over the Pre-work material for Week 1 that I need complete by Friday. I made a little video below to demonstrate!
