The end of summer is nigh and the sweltering NYC heat has dissipated (somewhat). I am glad to not be sweating to death the minute I walk outside. Now I am just huffing and puffing my way up several flights of subway stairs like any other NYer.

Last night, I received my creditentials to access the "pre-work" material for Actualize. The student portal is web application is nuilt with ROR (obvi). I am really excited to get started! The pre-work is mandatory and must be successfully completed in other to continue with the live course portion (which starts in late October).

I am a little nervous about throwing all of my energy into Actualize. Truth be told my favorite pastimes include sleep and reality TV -- both of which are going to seriously be compromised over the next 4 months in an effort to stay on track but it is my intention to successfully complete this program without crashing and burning.

I am also attending my very first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CodeNewbie-NYC/events/234025796/">NYC coding meetup</a> with <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbies</a> next Friday evening. It will be great to be surrounded by like-minded people.

My goal is to complete my Intro Ruby tutorial before the weekend is out so that I can start on the official Actualize pre-work on Sunday.
