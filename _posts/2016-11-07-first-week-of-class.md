This past week has been a whirlwind. I started my first week of bootcamp and it was pretty intense. There was so much information being thrown my way that even with my pristine lawyer-taking abilities, I know that I did not catch everything. Nevertheless, I am trying to keep up with the regular habit of blogging about my experience as close to real-time as possible.  

### Things that I learned:  
  - Bash commands  
  - Things to try when you are feeling stuck in a problem  
  - Pair programming  
  - Benefits of working on open-source projects  
  - Ruby inheritance  
    + The keyword: **super**  
    + attr_reader  
    + attr_writer  
    + attr_accessor  
  - How to install packages in Sublime  
    + Ruby Linter  
  - Ruby Modules  
  - CSS and HTML  
    + Bootstrap  
    + Materialize  
    + Chrome Dev tools `cmd + option + I`  
  - Rails  
    + rails server  
    + controller  
    + router.rb  
    + html.erb files  
      * embedding html in ruby files  

Yesterday, we made our first rails application. I am definitely going to keep working on it so that I can demo it as a project.
