I am now in week #2 of 15 and things are moving along fine. At first I was panicking that I had quite a bit of work due by this Saturday but the deadline is actually next Friday and so that is a bit of relief. This week I am learning more about Ruby methods and hashes. Yesterday, I even did 5 katas on <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Codewars</a> to give the website another try and try and keep my mind sharp. It turns out that programming in Ruby is much more intuitive for me than in JavaScript. I'm sure many people feel that way...or not. 

Also, last Friday, I attended a <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/" target="_blank">CodeNewbie</a> meet up. It was interesting and very well attended. There wasn't much time for mingling or networking because it was an actual event centered around "Art and Code". I learned about <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> which is a JavaScript library with the goal of <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> which is very useful for creative types or anyone who wants to draw by code. p5.js was created by <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com/" target="_blank">Lauren McCarthy.</a> Here is an example called <a href="http://p5js.org/examples/interaction-follow-1.html" target="_blank">'Follow'</a> where a line segment is pushed and pulled by the cursor.
