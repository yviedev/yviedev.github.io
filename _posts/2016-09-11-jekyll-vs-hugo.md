I was able to add tags to my website which will make it so much easier to keep track of my progress as I blog. I also added the 2 most recent blog posts to the home page. Both were a bit of a hassle trying to figure it out especially since I am not an expert in the Ruby language, but it was worth the effort.

I also had the chance to play around with some Hugo templates. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is similar to Jekyll (they are both fast and modern static websites) except that Hugo is written in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> language instead of Ruby. After some time, I found Jekyll easier to work with and Hugo a bit convuluted when trying to implement various themes.

Later on today I plan to read and do a few chapters of <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning">RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL (RAILS 5)</a> by Michael Hartl. I have my IDE set up for Rails and I am looking forward to it. ;-)

Now time for sleep. #Zzzz
