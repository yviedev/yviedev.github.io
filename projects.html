            <p>My Family Tree is a web application written in Rails 5, Vanilla JS, JQuery, HTML5/SASS/CSS that allows its users to join a family group for the purpose of being able to add family members and/or communicate with other family members. The important features of this app include adding family members and details, a family newsfeed which includes status updates of participating family members, family members images, and geo-locations. There is a Google Charts API visual representation of each family member on a “family tree” and a Google Maps API to show each family member's geo-location on a map. I chose to build this app because I have a large extended family and thought this would be a fun way to allow technology to act as a historian while allowing families to keep in touch in a more private and secure setting. </p>

            <p>Yvonne Captures is a web application powered by SmugMug that I use to showcase my photography skills. I customized the website on the front-end with HTML5/SASS/CSS to make it clean, fun to look at and easy to navigate.</p>
