            <p>My Family Tree is a web application written in Rails 5, Vanilla JS, JQuery, HTML5/SASS/CSS that allows its users to join a family group for the purpose of being able to add family members and/or communicate with other family members.</p>
            <p>The important features of this app include adding family members and details, a family <a href="/img/mft/newsfeed.png" target="_blank">newsfeed</a> which includes status updates of participating family members, <a href="/img/mft/familymembers.png" target="_blank">family members images</a>, and geo-locations.</p>
            <p>There is a Google Charts API visual representation of each family member on a <a href="/img/mft/tree.png" target="_blank">“family tree”</a> and a Google Maps API to show each family member's geo-location on a <a href="/img/mft/map.png" target="_blank">map</a>. I chose to build this app because I have a large extended family and thought this would be a fun way to allow technology to act as a historian while allowing families to keep in touch in a more private and secure setting. </p>
