It is almost Saturday and my coding bootcamp officially starts Sunday. I am pretty nervous and excited. I'm wondering "What the $#&* did I get myself into?" but also wondering "Why did you take so long to get to this point?" I could be out with friends celebrating the fact that the weather is just right for having a good time, but I am here updating my blog and attempting to add some svg icons before I get started on my Pre-Work. #thelife

I came across an interesting <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/newbie-story-latoya-allen">Code Newbie podcast</a> interviewing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latoyaellisallen">LaToya Allen</a>. LaToya is an awesome software engineer who studied with <a href="https://8thlight.com/">8th Light</a> and went on to work for <a href="https://www.avant.com/">Avant</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/">Big Cartel</a> and started her own organization called <a href="http://www.shenomads.com/">SheNomads</a> which is geared towards helping women in the tech industry find inclusive job opportunities and retain the ability to travel while working. LaToya is just awesome awesome awesome! She also wrote this <a href="https://medium.com/shenomads/why-i-wont-make-it-past-your-careers-page-e7408a67f813#.brhpyp4zl"> very thought provoking piece </a> on how exclusive many tech companies can be. I connected with her on twitter yesterday and I hope we can link up when she is in NYC.
